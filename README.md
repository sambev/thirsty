thirsty
=======

Base project creation script.  Sets up a project with Flask, Foundation, and Grunt.

Dependencies
------------
python 2.7.5
virtualenv 1.10.1 (optional... but not really, use it)
pip 1.4.1
Ruby 2.0.0p247 (sass)
Bower 1.2.8
NPM 1.3.14
** All these versions could be relative. Newer versions probably work


Still under heavy development.

Run it with:

`python thirsty.py new project <name>`

View creation is up next and a global install
